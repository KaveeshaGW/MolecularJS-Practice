# MolecularJS-Practice

Moleculer is a framework for Node.js used to create micro services
Here we have 
1. created a new service (services->helper.service.js)
2. registered an event handler (inside helper service)
3. created an action (inside helper)
4. called an action from another action
   - action calls are asynchronous
   - we add async infront of the name of the action we call from
